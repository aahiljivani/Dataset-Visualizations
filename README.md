# Data Analysis and Visualization Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis and Visualization Portfolio on GitHub! This repository is a comprehensive showcase of my skills in extracting insights from data and presenting them through clear and compelling visualizations.

## About

In this repository, you'll find a series of projects and scripts that demonstrate my ability to work with large datasets and my proficiency in using Python's most powerful libraries - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy. From data wrangling and exploration to advanced visual storytelling techniques.

Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: Utilized for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Employed for numerical computations and handling large multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: Leveraged for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: Used for making attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## Projects

Each project in this repository is contained in its own directory, complete with datasets and a Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`) that details the analysis process from start to finish. Here's what you can expect to find:
